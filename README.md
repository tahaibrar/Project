*Evaporation: The Silent Escape 🌫️*

Evaporation is the process where a liquid turns into vapor (gas) at a temperature below its boiling point. It's a key part of the water cycle and happens all around us – think drying puddles, wet clothes, or even sweat evaporating on a hot day.

How It Works 🔍
- *Energy Boost*: Molecules at the liquid surface gain enough energy (from heat, wind, etc.) to break free and become vapor.
- *Factors Affecting Evaporation*:
    - 🔥 *Temperature*: Higher temps = faster evaporation.
    - 💨 *Wind/Airflow*: More airflow = faster evaporation (think blowing on soup).
    - 💧 *Surface Area*: Larger surface = faster evaporation (spreading clothes to dry).
    - 💦 *Humidity*: Less humidity = faster evaporation (dry air sucks up moisture).

Examples 🌍
- 🌞 Puddles drying after rain.
- 🏋️‍♂️ Sweat evaporating, cooling you down.
- 🌿 Plants releasing water vapor (transpiration).
